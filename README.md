Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is systematic application of engineering principles and tool to develop and maintain high quality
software system.
software engineeingis important because it provides reliable and high quality software that can be easily maintained and meet
the users need. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The rise of Agile methodologies-it emphasises on development, collaboration and adaptability through frequent feedback
and responding to changing requirements.
The introduction of the waterfall model- it provided a clear and structural framework by following step-by-step manner when it comes
to software development, hence easy identification of its limitation.
The emergence of structured programming- it emerged as a respond to complex progamming by breaking down code into manageable section 
to enhnce readability and maintainance.This set stage for develpment and advancement in software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning -identify the objective and resources required for the project
2. Requirement analysis -gathering information on what the user needs from the software.
3. Design- create a detailed design of the software
4. Implemantation -writting actual code based on the design specification
5. Testing -ensures that the meets the the intended requirment
6. Deployment - release the software to the user
7. Maintance -ongoing support through adapting the software to changes the user may need


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Agile is flexible while waterfall is structured  and follows the step by step manner
Waterfall receives feedback after completion of the software whereas in Agile feedback is continous
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developers are responsible for designing ,coding and implementing software application based on the requirements provided
QA engineer ensure that that the software is on high quality and free of defect and meets the specfication provided at the beginning of the project
Project manager oversee the project through planning ,executing and ensuring the project is completed on time.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide tools and features that streamline coding ,debugging and testing process while VCS manages and tracks codehence facilitates collaboration among team members
through reviewing hence they both complement each other to enhance productivity and code quality

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
time constrant- through setting realistic time lines for projects 
Requirement managemeny -ensure a detailed document for the requirement is provided and incase of any changes made a formal chanel is used

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing- test individual function of a software to ensure it works as intended. This helps identify issues and maintain code quality.
2.Integrated testing -test the intaraction between intergrated components to ensure they work together as expected. identify interface issues.
3.system testing- test the complete software system to ensure it meets the specified requirement. to validate that the system function as expected
under different condition
4. Acceptance testing -the software meets business requirement and is ready for delivery. ensure customer satisfaction

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
this is the process of structuring commands that are easy interpreted and understood by AI models to give accurate and desired result.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
give me directions to the market-  give diections to mtindwa market
it is specific and simple
